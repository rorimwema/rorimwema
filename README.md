### About Me

I'm deeply fascinated by how programming languages work and how compilers bridge human-readable code with machine instructions. My journey involves:

- Studying PL & Compilers
- Unix systems and shell scripting
- Building efficient, scalable AI integrations
- Sharing what I learn along the way
