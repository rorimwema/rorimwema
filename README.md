    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm a software engineer who loves programming, designing scalable systems, and exploring distributed architectures. I enjoy working on projects involving cloud-native technologies, system design, or anything focused on stability and performance.</p>
    
    <p>When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me debugging with a cup of coffee in hand ‚òïÔ∏è or admiring whales üê≥‚Äîtwo of my favorite things! I also occasionally share my thoughts on <a href="https://dev.to/rorimwema">Dev.to</a>.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to collaborate or just chat about tech, feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:clintonrorim@gmail.com">clintonrorim@gmail.com</a>.</p>
